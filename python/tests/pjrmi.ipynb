    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "PJRmi is an API for performing Remote Method Invocation (RMI, aka RPC) in a Java process from a Python one, and vice versa. The principle it works by is to create shim objects in Python which the user will transparently treat as they would most Python objects, but which actually cause things to happen inside the Java process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main modes of operation:\n",
    "  1. A Java child process spawned from a Python parent.\n",
    "  1. A Java process which runs a PJRmi server, which Python clients may connect to.\n",
    "  1. An in-process JVM, created inside the Python process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the common server use-case, in order to provide a connection, a user must instantiate a PJRmi thread in their Java process. This can then register a service with our internal systems which the Python client can connect to. It's also possible to create a server instance which listens on a secured socket."

    "## These examples...\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the parent/child model in the examples below but pretty much everything you can do in one mode you can do in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in the Python client, there are two ways which one can get a handle on a Java object instance. You can either construct an object directly from a class, or you can get a handle on an existing object, provided by the PJRmi instance. The former case is just like creating a new Python object, and is something which we'll see a lot of below. The latter case is handled by the PJRmi instance in the Java process being an instance of a subclass of the general PJRmi class, but with an override for the the `getObjectInstance()` method; this only really makes sense when you have an explicit PJRmi server in a Java process.\n",
    "\n",
    "PJRmi does everything by reflection so, aside from instantiating the PJRmi object in the Java process, you don't need any other boilerplate code."

We'll need the JNI extension to be loaded for this to work since it uses C++ magic behind the scenes.
