    "## Overview\n",
    "`hypercube` is an `ndarray`-like package for Java, designed to offer a representation for `numpy` `ndarray`s that is feature-rich in numerical computations. Furthermore, hypercubes are designed to be interoperable with `numpy`, as we'll show in the examples. Additionally, this package can be used to directly translate `numpy` code into Java. E.g., you can prototype in Python but, if you have a codebase which is using Java for the heavy computations, then Hypercube can aid the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the `hypercube` package, the `CubeMath` library is designed to offer many of `numpy`'s math operations for Hypercubes. As part of this effort, we have also developed `VectorizedCubeMath`, an experimental library, that offers SIMD-accelerated operations through [the Vector API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/426). It's worth making note here that [the Vector API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/426), as of 08/18/2023, is an incubator module in Java, and so it should be regarded as highly experimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be using hypercubes in Python (through PJRmi) for ease of demonstration. We'll be covering:\n",
    "- Hypercubes and `ndarray` operations on them\n",
    "- `CubeMath` and math operations on hypercubes\n",
    "- `VectorizedCubeMath` (experimental library)\n",
    "- Performance and benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we're passing the `includeVectorized` parameter to include `VectorizedCubeMath` in our build. By default, all Vectorized code is hidden from the build, since it requires Java 17 and we don't want to force users there unless we have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you are in the PJRmi directory and only have one wheel file, you can run something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./gradlew wheel -PincludeVectorized\n",
    "unzip -f python/pjrmi-*.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: If some of the cells in the below do not work, you may need to add the directory containing the wheel (e.g. `pjrmi/python`) to the `PYTHONPATH`. This can occur when the global PJRmi version differs from the one we just built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll setup a PJRmi connection. Note that we're:\n",
    "- Using shared memory passing (for our benchmarks)\n",
    "- Enabling the incubated Vector API module in Java to be able to use `VectorizedCubeMath`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note on Fine-Tuning Performance\n",
    "It's worth noting that both of the cube math libraries support multithreaded processing, as well as efficient loop unrolling. By default, both libraries use a staging size of 128 for better loop unrolling and 4 threads for multithreaded processing, which are only enabled after a rough threshold to avoid the overhead of multithreading. More formally:\n",
    "- Staging size: The number of elements to process \"in bulk\" (by default 128).\n",
    "- Number of threads: The number of threads to use when multithreading (by default 4).\n",
    "- Multithreading threshold: The cube size at which Cube Math will enable multithreaded processing (by default 131,072).\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters can all be arbitrarily set to fine-tune the performance of the cube math libraries to specific environments or machines. To do so, we can pass the following corresponding Java properties when initializing our Java connection.\n",
    "- `com.deshaw.hypercube.cubemath.stagingSize` -- The number of elements to stage when processing operations in bulk.\n",
    "- `com.deshaw.hypercube.cubemath.threadingThreshold` -- The cube size threshold at which VectorizedCubeMath will use multithreading.\n",
    "- `com.deshaw.hypercube.cubemath.numThreads` -- The number of threads used for multithreaded processing."

    "### Translating `numpy` to Java\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, we might find the need or the desire to translate code written in `numpy` to Java. Here, we are going to show you the very broad formula for doing this translation. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to use Hypercube or CubeMath differently, but these general instructions will hopefully provide useful insights for the users:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Magic methods: While Python supports magic dunder functions like `len()`, Java lacks such a feature and so hypercubes cannot use the same syntax in Java (this is also the case for operator overloading, e.g. doing `array[indices]`). However, Hypercube implements similar methods that can be used to achieve the same functionality (`cube.getObj(indices)` and `cube.get(indices)` as opposed to `array[indices]`). Alternatively, you can explicitly call the corresponding dunder methods on hypercubes (e.g., `cube.__getitem__(indices)`), although we do not recommend this behavior.\n",
    "2. It is worth noting here that due to how Java's type system works, primitive hypercubes (e.g., `IntegerHypercube` etc.) offer both object methods, and primitive ones for many of their operations (e.g., `cube.getObj(indices)` and `cube.get(indices)` as mentioned above). While all these method work as expected, we encourage using the latter for primitive hypercubes, since methods that deal with objects tend to make for a lousy performance, significantly slower than their primitive counterparts.\n",
    "3. Static methods instead of member methods: While `numpy` provides many of its operations as instance methods, hypercubes (as of 08/24/2023) do not do the same. For example, while you are able to write `array.sum()`, using `cube.sum()` will not work. However, Hypercube offers `ndarray` math operations as part of the CubeMath library that can be used as static method. For example, you would do the same as above by calling `CubeMath.sum0d(cube)` (note that `numpy` supports a similar static notation, i.e. `numpy.sum(array)`).\n",
    "4. Type casting: CubeMath and `numpy` differ in the way they handle type-casting for certain operations. For example, `numpy` always converts integer arrays to real arrays before performing certain math operations like sin and cos. CubeMath, on the other hand, was designed to loosely follow Java's typing system, meaning that floating-point operations (like sin, cos) are not supported on integer cubes. When translating `numpy` code to Java, think about how you want to cubes to be casted, before certain operations. Conveniently, CubeMath supports casting methods that can be used to do this."

    "### Benchmarks and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Now finally, let's dive into the exciting realm of performance and see how CubeMath and VectorizedCubeMath compare to each other, as well as to `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting here that we're not trying to outperform or replace `numpy`, but rather try to mainly show _comparable_ performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical note on vectorization:\n",
    "All supported operations in VectorizedCubeMath use the Vector API internally, while none in CubeMath do. However, certain operations in CubeMath can be auto-vectorized by compilers and thus be translated into SIMD instructions. This is one of the reasons that for certain operations, CubeMath performs similarly or even slightly faster than VectorizedCubeMath.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical note on multithreaded processing:\n",
    "By default CubeMath and VectorizedCubeMath use 4 threads when using multithreaded processing (which is the case here).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, It's more difficult to reason about `numpy`'s multithreading and the exact number of threads it uses. Internally, `numpy` uses multiple multithreaded math libraries (e.g., Intel MKL and LAPACK) that work independently and use a different number of threads. This is different from the PJRmi threading model. While it is possible to individually limit the number of used threads on the internal libraries, configuring the number of threads is idiosyncratic to the various underlying backend libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take note that the performance of these libraries are highly dependant on their configurations. For more accurate comparisons, it is very important to make sure you configure CubeMath and `numpy`'s multithreaded processing to use similar resources. For more information on the internal backend libraries that your `numpy` is using, you can run the `numpy.show_config()` command that provides all the relevant backend details, as well as supported SIMD instructions. For more information on the multithreading schemes of the individual backend libraries, consult the libraries documentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For our benchmarks, we'll be using IPython's own magic `%timeit` function on randomly generated 64-bit floating-point arrays of 100 million elements. This large array size is deliberately chosen to reduce the relative noise of the benchmark instruments, as well as PJRmi communication between Python and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should test the performance of these libraries with your desired functions, data types and array sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before we begin...\n",
    "Here we define some utility methods for creating `numpy` arrays and hypercubes, plus some _type abstractions_ for the sake of easier testing in Python. Really, what we're doing here is abstracting the internal hypercube implementations, for easier cube initialization in Python."
